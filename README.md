# Django Signals Demo

This repository demonstrates the synchronous execution of Django signals by default.

## Files

- `signals_demo.py`: Contains a Django model and a signal handler to show how signals are executed synchronously.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and a Q&A section about Django signals.

## Question and Answer

### By default, are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously?

**Answer:**
By default, Django signals execute synchronously. This means that when a signal is sent, the connected receivers are executed one by one in the same order in which they were connected, and the signal sender waits for all receivers to finish before continuing execution.

Here’s a code snippet that demonstrates this behavior:

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received for:", instance.name)

# Creating an instance of MyModel
obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Test")
print("Object created")  # This will be printed after the signal handler completes

### Steps to Update the `README.md`:

1. **Navigate to the `README.md` File**:
   - Go to your repository at [https://github.com/vikas-artist1/django-signals-demo](https://github.com/vikas-artist1/django-signals-demo).
   - Click on the `README.md` file.

2. **Edit the `README.md` File**:
   - Click on the pencil icon (✏️) in the upper-right corner to edit the file.

3. **Add the Content**:
   - Replace the existing content or add the new content as shown above.

4. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Scroll down to the `Commit changes` section.
   - In the `Commit message` text box, enter a commit message such as "Update README.md with Django signals Q&A".
   - In the `Extended description` text box, enter: `This update adds a detailed Question and Answer section to the README.md file to explain the default synchronous execution of Django signals. It includes a code snippet to demonstrate how signals are executed one by one in the same order they were connected, and how the signal sender waits for all receivers to finish before continuing execution. This addition will help users understand the behavior of Django signals and provide a practical example for reference.`
   - Ensure the `Commit directly to the main branch` option is selected.
   - Click on the `Commit changes` button.

By following these steps, your `README.md` will be updated with a clear and informative section on Django signals, along with an extended description to explain the significance of this update.
